# Neural Art Project

This is a class project for the second semester of the ENSAE. 
It is an application designed to use [Zhang's Pytorch Implementation of his MSG-Net for neural 
style transfer](https://github.com/zhanghang1989/PyTorch-Multi-Style-Transfer).

### Requirements

You need to use a machine with python 3.6 and pip installed 
(preferably in a virtual environment). 

## Setting up the application

The idea was to provide a "straight out of the box" implementation with a simple interface to run it.

- Clone the directory (`git clone https://github.com/LoicEm/Neural_art_project`).

- Check that you have the permission to exectute the files in the folder and run `setup.sh`

## Launching the application

Once the setup is done, you just need to run the `launch.sh`. 
A tab with the app pop up in your default browser !
